DNS Configuration for framewave.studio

Add these DNS records in GoDaddy DNS management:

1. A record for @ (root) → 76.76.21.21
2. CNAME for www → cname.vercel-dns.com

Current nameservers need to be changed to:
- ns1.vercel-dns.com
- ns2.vercel-dns.com

OR alternatively, just add the A and CNAME records above without changing nameservers.

After adding records, wait a few minutes for propagation, then run:
vercel domains verify framewave.studio
